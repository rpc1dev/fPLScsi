v1.1 - o Improved Linux support:
	  Recent versions of the Linux kernel do sgio passthru natively, and cancel the
	  need for the SCSI generic module and /dev/sg#
	  For instance, you can now access a /dev/hdc DVD-ROM directly
	  sgioReadName() was modified accordingly for proper scanning of these devices.
	o DOS/DPMI support files now included (for DJGPP users)

v1.0 - first release
